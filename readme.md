Projects for computer programming classes. everything is in C/C++, because that's what these classes were about.

# Projects description
You can build these projects by running `make` inside them.
## PK1
Topic "TUC". In short you give program list of logic gates, tell it which cables are connected where, and tell program what are inputs and outputs of program. Then you wait for output of the program.

## PK2
Topic "Wheel Of Fortune". It had to be written in C, so it is. Program loads wheel fields and passwords from data directory and lets user play against bots.

## PK3
Topic "Boulder Dash". As far as I could tell it's a game where you walk around map, collect diamonds, avoid lava and boulders. If you walk below boulder it falls. Lava fills empty places around it. Your goal is to get as many points and go as far as you can by collecting diamonds and moving to exit.

## PK4
Topic "Space Shooter". There's ship at the bottom and it constantly shoots up. Then enemies and powerups are arriving from the top. You have to survive as long as you can.
